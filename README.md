# Chatroom App
This is a basic chatroom app I worked on to familiarize myself with socket.io.


**How to use**
- Run `npm start` to serve the application on your machine.
- Find your ip address (ex: `ipconfig` in your cmd)
- Other devices can chat with you as long as they are on the same network if they go to `your_ip_address:4444` in their browser!

Tools used:
- Socket.io
- Node.js
- Express.js
- jQuery
